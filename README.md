# User Stories

I am a Motorbike fan and have been for many years. I use my motorbike for leasure only. As a user of this platform I aim to find likeminded biker fans to arrange weekend get togethers and go for short trips around the countryside. I believe in safety by numbers and by arranging trips in groups, we can experience memorable trips whilst supporting eachother along the way. This is a great platform for meeting other like minded bikers looking for similar expereinces. By signing in to this website I am automatically shown memebers near me allowing me to "buddy up" with them.

* I will expect to find a navigation bar where I will identify the website logo and some login and registration functionalities. I will also see a bar menu which will include links to all the web pages so that I will not spend time jumping from one page to the next in order to find the information I require.

* In the middle of the page I will see a "hero" image of bikers having fun riding their bikes. There will be 4 or 5 different images in a loop which will add to my user experience of the home page.

* Below the hero image I will identify card tiles with existing members' reviews of the site and their experiences so far.

* At the bottom of the page I will see the copyright icon together with some buttons with links allowing me to navigate to other pages for more details as required.
