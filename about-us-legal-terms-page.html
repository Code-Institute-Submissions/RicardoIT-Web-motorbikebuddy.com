        <h2>Who we are:</h2>
    <br>
            <p> Motorbike Buddy is a TOTALLY FREE platform which allows members to find other likeminded biker fans to go riding with. Safety by numbers is our main focus. No matter what kind of a biker you are, you have a home here. Motorbike Buddy is a global platform which will unite biker fans from all over the globe, allowing members to arrange events and meet up for social gatherings.
            </p>
    <br>
            <p>Our aim is to create a global community, a single destination website for people looking for news, views and reviews on motorbiking. The roads can be a hazerdous place for motorbike lovers so this platform will allow members to find other bikers to enjoy the same adventures by traveling in groups safely.
            </p>
    <br>
        <h2>Why we care:</h2>
    <br>
            <p>We love Motorbiking and we love the social aspects and adventures that Motorbiking can bring. We are all too concious of the various risks inherant with motorbiking. Whilst we cannot eliminate these risks, we want to create a platform that can bring useful information to bike fans which we hope will provide our members with more information to make informed choices about motorbike riding.</p>
    <br>
            <p>There have been several interesting articles written around the safety of Motorbiking which we encourage our members to read and reflect. <a href="http://www.fema-online.eu/website/wp-content/uploads/motorcycle_safety_and_accidents_europe_hdb_050816.pdf" target="_blank" alt="Article on Motorbiking statistics in EU wrtitten by FEMA">A Summary Report by FEMA</a></p>
    <br>
        <h2>What we do:</h2>
            <p>We provide a platform for Biker fans to register with us and arrange meet ups. The platform will allow hosts to advertise their events, allowing members to subscribe and join in on their adventures.</p>
